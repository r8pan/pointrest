### Motivations

Social networks have done a great job of connecting people, but what is missing from the conventional social networking experience is that it’s harder to connect people and places. Imagine it’s a Friday night and you want to go out with your friends, but turns out you don’t know where to go? Lots of people find themselves in this situation, whether it’s be because they are new to the area or have exhausted the list of popular places to go to. The goal of our app is simple, to give them the opportunity to discover exciting new locations that will interest them.

The motivation for our app is that we feel like it’s hard to find new places without the specific location advertised to you. This can result in a lot of neat locations getting swept under the rug. We decide to allow users to submit their own locations, which gives smaller places a better shot at being discovered by the people who would be interested in them. We want to develop a bond between people and the cities they are exploring.

We wrap our heads around following hypotheses when building our application:
* People are interested in different types of locations
* Planning is a hassle and is frustrating for people
* People want to know about cool spots/ experiences other people have had.
* People want their friends opinion about a place before their visit

### Design Process

We followed the development cycle shown below for our application:

### Understand our users

We want to target mainly three types of users: travellers, new residents, long term residents, and event promoters, and we divide new residents into working people and students. Travellers don’t have much time staying in one city, so they want to hit major/popular points of interests. They value quality of the trip and have comparatively high expectation. New residents have higher tolerance with few unpleasant experience, and instead they value more social functions these places provide. Students should have more time and usually travel in groups, and
they are more active on social media, while working people may want more personal time exploring these places. Long term residents already visit most of the city’s attractions, so they would be more likely to explore exotic places that may be forgotten. Event promoters consider more about popularity of the place, its main customer type, and when a good time is for such an event.

We designed some personas to help us understand our users' needs better:

Then we conducted several interviews with people who was similar to our anticipated target users.

### Translating needs into functionalities

From interviews, we made an affinity diagram to find out some common issues existing in the interviews, together with work models. We concluded that there are four major findings we could use for our application:

* People value the opinions of their friends over all else
* Reviews and Pictures are a good secondary source besides friends
* People want to find other people with common interests
* Organizing events can be challenging for the average person

### Create design ideas

We drew some sketches and story boards for our intial design ideas:

And we decided to focus on following functionalities as our major features in design:

* Providing users with their friends (or other explorers) opinion on an event or a location
* Helping our users socialize with the locals
* Adding a simple event organization medium

### Prototype design

We made a paper prototype first, then we made a high fidelity prototype:

This is our paper prototype:

The link below is our high-fi prototype. We designed in with Adobe XD and used iPhone 8 as the model:

### Test and Evaluate

Great thanks to our evaluation participants. They gave our some much great feedback so that we could improve our prototype.

We had two rounds of prototypes, one for each typed stated in the last section.

We gave them basically the same 4~5 tasks for both evaluations:

* Find a location and find its reviews
* find out what yor friends are currently up to
* create an event
* update your interest

Since these four tasks are the main design that we focused on for our application.

In paper prototype evaluation we found some following issues:

* It’s difficult to add new events or locations
* The location details page hides information
* The menu icon was unintuitive

Based on these findings, we modified our paper prototype in following ways:
* We have enlarged the add event button and improved the styling to make it more clearly communicate that it is a button for adding new events. 
* We have also changed the way we display location details. We have decided to move the action buttons to the very top of the page, so the users have easy access to decisions should they feel informed enough to make quick decisions and avoid the notion that the detail page ends with the action buttons. Incorporating the use of closure in Gestalt Principle, we have purposely left the Review headers cropped up half way, indicating clearly to users that there is more information below, and prompting them to scroll down and see more reviews.
* The improvements for the menu icon is unfeasible on the paper prototype due to the restraints of resolution and image size, but we have opted to add annotations to the menu navigation icon like Pinterest has on their apps in our high-fidelity prototype. This should help users figure out what the icons represent, should the icons be insufficient.

We enlarged the add button, and we changed the display style to indicate the pape is incomplete, and there are reviews to been seen.
