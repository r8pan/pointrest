### Motivations

Social networks have done a great job of connecting people, but what is missing from the conventional social networking experience is that it’s harder to connect people and places. Imagine it’s a Friday night and you want to go out with your friends, but turns out you don’t know where to go? Lots of people find themselves in this situation, whether it’s be because they are new to the area or have exhausted the list of popular places to go to. The goal of our app is simple, to give them the opportunity to discover exciting new locations that will interest them.

The motivation for our app is that we feel like it’s hard to find new places without the specific location advertised to you. This can result in a lot of neat locations getting swept under the rug. We decide to allow users to submit their own locations, which gives smaller places a better shot at being discovered by the people who would be interested in them. We want to develop a bond between people and the cities they are exploring.

We wrap our heads around following hypotheses when building our application:
* People are interested in different types of locations
* Planning is a hassle and is frustrating for people
* People want to know about cool spots/ experiences other people have had.
* People want their friends opinion about a place before their visit
